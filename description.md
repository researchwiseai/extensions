# Pulse: AI-Powered Text Analysis for Google Sheets

Pulse is a Google Sheets add-on powered by ResearchWise AI that brings advanced qualitative text analysis capabilities directly into your spreadsheets. With Pulse, you can transform unstructured text data—such as survey responses, customer feedback, social media comments, and more—into meaningful insights without leaving the familiar Google Sheets environment.

## Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Instantly evaluate the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of selected text entries. Pulse analyzes your data via the ResearchWise AI Sentiment API and writes sentiment labels adjacent to each cell, giving you a clear view of overall tone and emotional distribution.
- **Automatic Theme Generation**: Discover emerging themes and topics in your text data. Select any range of cells and generate a custom set of thematic categories. Pulse leverages AI-driven clustering to propose concise theme labels and representative excerpts from your data.
- **Theme Allocation & Management**:
  - Allocate generated or previously saved theme sets back to your full dataset, assigning the most relevant theme to each entry.
  - Save new theme sets with custom names, then revisit, rename, or delete them at any time using the built-in Manage Themes dialog.
- **Seamless UI Integration**: After installation, Pulse adds a **Pulse** menu to your Google Sheets toolbar, offering one-click access to all tools:
  1. **Analyze Sentiment**
  2. **Generate Themes**
  3. **Allocate Themes**
  4. **Manage Themes**
  5. **Settings**
- **Secure Account Connection**: Connect your ResearchWise AI account via the Settings sidebar. Pulse uses OAuth2 for secure authentication and stores your preferences in your Google account.
